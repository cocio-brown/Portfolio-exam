                <h2>What I've learned</h2>
                <p class="basicWebTxt1">In this project I had my first experiences with the programs typically involved with being a multimedia designer. Programs such as: Brackets, Illustrator and Photoshop. <br>
                    I learned useful tools to work from such as creating a style tile and of course hand coding with HTML and CSS. <br><br>
                    A very important part of creating any product, in this case a digital one- is testing.<br> Testing for me before this module seemed like a very tedious task that could be skipped over quickly. But by learning how to conduct tests like the 5-second test and the Trunk test, I realized how insightful testing can be for your progress and final result.<br><br>
                    Designing my first responsive website was a huge challenge for me, since I’ve never touched any of the knowledge or tools needed. Knowledge such as color theory and gestalt principles and the tools I mentioned earlier.

                <h2>What I'd change</h2>
                <p class="basicWebTxt1">The biggest thing I would change today, is the use of grids. I’ve only now at the very end of the semester, gotten to get how helpful using grids is. <br>Overall the whole design was kind of neglected, because of my lack of technical skills in terms of coding. <br>So, revisiting the design and esthetics of the responsive website are defiantly two main issues I would tackle first.
