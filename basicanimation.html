                <p class="basicAnimationTxt1">
                    I chose flat design because I wanted to play with the shapes of the style. The basic shapes such as triangles and circles, can be used in so many ways, and that’s definitely something I learned during this course. <br><br>
                    I got to go more in depth with HTML and CSS coding, as animating a sprite sheet required new knowledge such as the animation functions in CSS.<br><br>
                    During this course we were introduced to the 12 animation principles, which teaches how a character comes to life and affects the expectations of the viewer. I did the pose to pose principle with my animation illustrated in my characters waving hand.

                <p class="basicAnimationTxt1">
                    I would definitely change the look of my stile tile. Though it contains the information it’s supposed to have, it doesn’t scream flat design at all. <br>
                    I would include more pictures of character traits and colors to make it more inviting and interesting to look at and be inspired by. Furthermore, I’d like to have added some life into my characters eyes and made her blink once in a while.

                <h2>What i've learned</h2>
                In this project I was taught an important lesson about teamwork. How different people communicate and work together with diverse skills. <br><br>My main focus was on coding, but I actually ended up being very involved with the design decisions.
                I created the persona collage for this project and there was a very high agreement amongst the group members on how we envisioned this persona. <br><br>So, in the end we were all very pleased with the result of that piece of the project.

<br><br><br>
                <h2>What i'd change</h2>
                I really want to lower the expectations I have for myself in general, and in this project I felt the consequence that follow when taking on too much in an effort to please.
