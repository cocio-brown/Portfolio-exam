                <p>With a design sprint you have to follow certain steps, and that experience was both very fun and hard. <br>Limiting yourself to an amount of time to come up with creative things while still remaining open to sometimes crazy ideas, was what I found most challenging about this project.  <br> <br>The user testing part was very fun to execute, but also quite difficult. Asking the right questions might seem like a breeze, but it’s actually a very tough task.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What i'd change</h2>
                <p>I would probably change the design and color scheme of this prototype… </p>

                <h2>What i've learned</h2>
                <p>As earlier mentioned, I was far off happy with the visual part of our prototype. I tried to start over but hit a bunch of challenges that could’ve been limited by going with what my group and I had already created. <br><br>With this I was taught a valuable lesson! In real life, I could easily find myself in a situation, where a costumer has a clear vision that I don’t visually agree with at all… and I should be able to deliver a high-quality piece of work regardless! <br><br>Lesson learned!</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What i'd change</h2>
                <p>I would redo my remake to match the prototype we made in the design sprint, to strengthen my ability to work with design that I might not agree with.</p>
